My wife and I started the restaurant Northeast Kingdom in Bushwick years ago and recently decided to close it and move on to other things. 

I still love cooking and all things about food. We run a small farm stand now at our house/garden  in the Hudson Valley. We have chickens and grow flowers and make pesto and pickles...and we have kids. So were are pretty busy most of the time. I like it that way. 
I listen to music - Bon Iver to the specials and sometimes play guitar badly.
I love reading but don't do enough of it. Last book I read my have been Harry Potter because our son was reading it as well.
I'm clean and organized and it's reflected in our apartment.
We are not there much because we live upstate but it's very nicely furnished with everything you need to have a sweet landing pad, and it's right on the park!

My name is Ryan and I am a teacher and basketball coach here in New Jersey. I lived in Brooklyn for many years and moved to my current apartment in Jersey City a year ago.

I enjoy traveling a lot so when my apartment is available it's usually because I am off on an adventures somewhere else. When I'm home, I am out enjoying the adventures NYC has to offer pretty much every weekend, or exploring more of Jersey City. 

Jersey City is great! It's pretty much like living in another borough of the city and am super happy with my move. There is a lot to do in the area and with the Journal Square path close by and NJ transit bus up the block, you can be in the city in 30 minutes door-to-door. I hope you get to enjoy my place!

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

Hello, and welcome to our home. My husband and I would be so happy to host you in our newly constructed Jersey City condo. We both share a huge passion for travel, and we have been blessed to live and visit many places all over the world. Chris and I decided to root ourselves in the city that has so much to offer which is Jersey City. While settling here, we decided to give our fellow travel lovers a place that feels like home. With southern hospitality in our roots, we have a deep love for hosting, and we look forward to extending that love and warmth to our new friends.
Our modern, sun-drenched condo offers a tranquil vibe, which is perfect to come home to after a long day of exploring the city. This location is perfect for families who want to visit Jersey City  or New York area. The location is prime for any sports enthusiasts as we are a quick fifteen-minute drive to MetLife stadium—home of the New York Giants and New York Jets. The area is also suited for travel healthcare professionals, as we are near many hospitals including Jersey City hospital. Newark international airport is a quick twelve-minute drive and in thirty minutes you are in the BIG APPLE! New York City.

We are Hassan and Patti, the self-proclaimed ""HoneyPots"". Join us as we embark on this new Airbnb hosting journey together. Here's just a little bit about us: 

Hassan is a Brooklyn Native (you won't meet many these days) who knows the ins and outs of this exciting and ever-changing NYC. Patti is what she likes to call a born-again New Yorker; after spending 10 years in Miami, she has returned to her home city and has never looked back. Hassan, a model and high-end security detail, met Patti, an artist and kitchen designer,  in the Spring of 2016. Patti has been hosting on Airbnb for over 5 years and they have been hosting together for over a year now.  

We are very excited to be hosting together in our hand-me-down apartment (it's a lot nicer than that sounds) and hope you all enjoy!
